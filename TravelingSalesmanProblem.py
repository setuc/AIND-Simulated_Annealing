    Parameters
    ----------
    cities : list
        A list of cities specified by a tuple containing the name and the x, y
        location of the city on a grid. e.g., ("Atlanta", (585.6, 376.8))

    Attributes
    ----------
    names
    coords
    path : list
        The current path between cities as specified by the order of the city
        tuples in the list.

        For example, if the current list of cities (i.e., the path) is [A, B, C, D]
        then the neighbors will include [A, B, D, C], [A, C, B, D], [B, A, C, D],
        and [D, B, C, A]. (The order of successors does not matter.)

        Setu: This one looks like a simple swap. The way I understand is that for N
        cities create a list of lists. Each list in the list is essentially a single
        swap between a pair of cities. Once its available, just append it to the
        neighbours. Continue till N.

        In general, a path of N cities will have N neighbors (note that path wraps
        around the end of the list between the first and last cities).

        """Calculate the total length of the closed-circuit path of the current
